### Hi there, I'm Agostino Convertini 👋

A curious web developer based in Rome :it:🤌🏻 but with [Apulian](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=563029658&sxsrf=AB5stBghkD8bUnjK3kxxu3HJWCU2__00ug:1693993205722&q=apulia&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwiRmJ262JWBAxUEhv0HHXkcDBwQ0pQJegQICxAB&biw=1728&bih=832&dpr=2) roots 🌴.

- [2014-2017] I've been working as a jr. full-stack developer on a LAMP stack, contributing to the development of customised customer care solutions - based on [LiveHelperChat](https://livehelperchat.com/) - but also to the development of [ComparaSemplice.it](https://www.comparasemplice.it/).
- [2017-2022] I started a new adventure in [MONK Software](https://www.monksoftware.it/it/about-monk) as a front-end developer, where I had the chance to deal with many different projects, going from ERPs, eCommerce websites, one-page applications, to customized webchat solutions for big TLC companies.
- [2022-2023] Still as a front-end developer, I'm now part of one of the [Best Place to Work in Italy](https://www.bestworkplaces.it/aziende/nebulab/) where I improved my overall experience by taking part to different and challenging projects like: co-operating to the development of a [Web3 auth platform](https://www.dynamic.xyz/), [rebranding one of the best eCommerce solution](https://solidus.io) on the web, and being a Shopify consultant for several customers.
- [ongoing] I started a new career journey by joining one of the biggest EU tech companies - [Minsait](https://www.minsait.com/en), an [Indra](https://www.indracompany.com/en) company - where I took part to the Phygital (Physical + Digital) team: a branch of Indra focused on providing 360-degrees IoT solutions.
